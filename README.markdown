# OpenPGP RFC 4880 and 6637

This is an initial (incomplete) attempt at a reasonably formal syntax and
semantics of PGP packets.

It is written vaguely in the style of TRX; see http://arxiv.org/abs/1105.2576
for details.

Because the resulting grammar is rather large, part of it is automatically
generated using Jinja2; the necessary script is present in this repository.
